## Idea

The big idea is to have, on multiple levels, a follower - or a twitterBot. First, our aim is to use a Roomba and an Arduino Mega ADK to have a piece of hardware that moves around, following a target and simultaneously, using a text to speech API, gets tweets from Twitter and reads them out loud in an annoying voice. 

This is the android application that gets tweets and reads them out in an annoying voice.
